# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning
This is a Streamlit-based web application that uses a trained PyTorch model to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model predicts the disease class and suggests possible solutions.

# 📌 Features
Upload leaf images to identify diseases.

Predicts class using a trained .pth model.

Shows the confidence score of the prediction.

Provides a short description and solution for each disease.

Simple UI powered by Streamlit.

Works locally in a single folder — no complex structure required.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
### Python

### PyTorch (for the model)

### Streamlit (for the web UI)

### Torchvision (for image transformations)

# 🚀 How to Run the App
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/aaqibali15/AI-Powered-Plant-Disease-Detection-System.git
cd AI-Powered-Plant-Disease-Detection-System

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the trained model file:

The model is larger than 25MB and cannot be uploaded to GitHub.

## 🔗 Model Download

You can download the trained `.pth` model file from the link below:

### - [Download model (.pth)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v3pmWeLCOLrdgoBB3uzMBFlA5ArEnoA_?usp=drive_link)


Place it in the same folder as app.py.

Run the app:
streamlit run app.py

# 🖼️ Example
After uploading a leaf image, the app will show:
