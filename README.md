🧠 AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection System 🌿
This project is an intelligent deep learning-based system that helps farmers, agronomists, and researchers identify plant diseases from leaf images. Powered by a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies plant leaves into various disease categories with high accuracy.

🔍 Project Overview
This AI-powered system uses image classification to detect diseases in plant leaves by analyzing visual patterns. It was trained on a labeled dataset of plant diseases and tested for real-world applicability.

🚀 Features:
Upload plant leaf images via web interface (Streamlit-based)

Classifies leaf image into one of several plant disease categories

Shows confidence/probability for each prediction

Provides disease name and suggested treatment

Lightweight frontend that runs locally or on cloud (e.g., Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces)
